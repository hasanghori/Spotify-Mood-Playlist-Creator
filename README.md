# SpotifyVibeCreator

We all have that playlist with all our songs that have way too much "stuff" to sort through. As a spotify addict, I have my fairshare of playlists with 1000+ songs. The issue is that playlist isn't the mood the vast majority of the time and you end up wasting hours continously skipping until you get the right song.

This program aims to help you solve that by creating subplaylists for you. Insert your main playlist, the type of subplaylist you want (chill, car, workout, etc), and this program will create that playlist for you.

Note: if you wish to run this program on your own computer, you will have to go to spotify developer 

Goal:
I finally have automatic authentication working and playlist generation, my next goal is to move the program to a website so it can be more accessable

Additional Features to Add: 
A shuffle option so you can shuffle your playlist based on your mood
Facial recognition to detect mood
display spotify statistics
